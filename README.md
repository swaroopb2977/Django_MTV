# Django_MTV
In Django, the Models-Template-Views (MTV) architectural pattern is used to develop web applications. It separates the different concerns of the application into three components: Models, Templates, and Views.

Models:

Models represent the data structure and logic of the application. They define the database schema and provide an abstraction layer to interact with the database.
Models are typically defined as Python classes that inherit from the django.db.models.Model base class.
Each attribute of a model class represents a field in the database table, such as CharField, IntegerField, ForeignKey, etc.
Models define relationships between different entities through fields like ForeignKey, ManyToManyField, and OneToOneField.
They can also include methods to perform operations or calculations on the data.


Templates:

Templates define the presentation layer of the application. They determine how the data is displayed to the users.
Templates are typically HTML files with Django template language (DTL) syntax.
DTL provides template tags and filters to manipulate and render the data dynamically.
Templates can include placeholders for dynamic content that is provided by views.


Views:

Views handle the business logic of the application. They receive HTTP requests from users and return appropriate HTTP responses.
Views define functions or class-based views that process the requests and generate the responses.
The logic in views can involve retrieving data from models, performing calculations, rendering templates, and returning responses.
Views can access and modify data through models and pass the data to templates for rendering.
The MTV pattern promotes a separation of concerns, making the code more maintainable and scalable. Models handle the data-related tasks, templates handle the presentation, and views handle the business logic. This separation allows for reusability, as different templates can be used with the same views, and models can be shared across multiple views and templates.

Overall, the Models-Template-Views pattern forms the core of Django's design philosophy and helps in building robust and modular web applications.
